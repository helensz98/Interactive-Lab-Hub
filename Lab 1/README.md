# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

Setting: This device is designed for usres who have bad peripheral visions. The user(visually impaired) will be using the device when crossing the road that does not have traffic lights. It takes place at night. 

Players: Main player will be the user who is carrying a band with the intelligent light (tinkerbell). Other factors include cars/bycicles on the road. 

Activity: User tries to cross the traffic-light-less road while cars/bycicles are passing by. The band will give blue light if it detects objects coming from the left and red light if something approaches from the right. Thus, user can react in time even if she/he fails to detect oncoming vehicles. 

Goals: User: go cross the stree. Vehicles: on.

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 
**Include a picture of your storyboard here**
<img src="https://github.com/helensz98/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/storyboard.jpeg"/>

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.
**Summarize feedback you got here.**

I did not finalize on the choice of design by the end of the class, so I did not get feedback from people in my breakout room. However, I did ask my friends how they feel like about this idea (not from CT). Some of them wondered whether it's best to set up the light on the wrist, since it implies that user will need to hold her/his hand up all the time to check the light. However, we did not come up with a better solution. 


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**
It's a little bit weird (but ok) to hold my right hand up all the time when crossing a road. 

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**
If we don't restrict ourselves to light, it is actually better to use a motion detector that's connected to a bluetooth airbud. Everytime a car is coming from the side, the detector can "voice" to the user. 


## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**
N/A. I did not manage to access Localhost. Therefore, I chose to manually operate a light switch and go solo. 

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

**Include your first attempts at recording [the set-up video here](https://youtu.be/wKCR1gi2IGM)**

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

**Show the follow-up work here.**

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.
A handband with my phone embedded as an intelligent motion detector that uses light to give warnings. 

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

The choice of colors is color blindness friendly and eyes catching.

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**
I want users to be able to notice immediately once the band changes color. Therefore, I cannot integrate the light source (my phone) with garments. In the end, I decided to make it a handband so that users can easily check out what's going on. 

## Part F. Record

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**

Erin Gong: The device still relies on user's vision. You can consider adding voice output so that users don't have to look down at their devices.

Beibei Lu: As the device is attached to wrist, adding vibration allows users to raise their wrists less often. Otherwise for visual aid, I think you could place the device on a pair of glasses. The video is a little bit confusing because there is a lag between user meeting the obstacle and the light indicator showing.

Zhonghao Zhan: When moving forward, you may want to integrate sound/vibration features as well since some of the users of this device might have more severe visual problems. 



## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**
Unlike last time, I do not need to look at my band all the time because of the newly added vibration and voice features. Everything works well but I start to wonder if it is a good device for the blind too. 
 


## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**
I only managed to open it once (due to some mysterious system problems I haven't solved). It's a good system but a bit confusing becuase there is a lag between clicking the play audio button and receiving a response.


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

**Include your first attempts at recording [the set-up video here](https://youtu.be/wKCR1gi2IGM)**

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype.

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**
Since the device is for people with visual disability, it should be simple and instinctive to use instead of focusing on the outlook.

# Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project Github page set up - May 3

Functional check-off - May 10
 
Final Project Presentations (video watch party) - May 12

Final Project Documentation due - May 19



## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design.
 
## Description

breakout clone:

<img src="https://github.com/helensz98/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Final%20Project/breakout_clone.jpg" height="300"> 

Players use bat to bounce the ball. When all bricks are cleared, players enter the next round. In each new round, the ball gains higher velocity.

Game is cleared when velocity reaches 0.2 and all bricks are removed. 

Pong game:

Make a pong game with led matrix, joystick and pi.

Players use the bat to catch the ball. For every five successful catches, the ball speeds up.

Game ends when players miss the ball more than three times or when players beat the fastest speed.

## Deliverables

1. Documentation of design process
2. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
3. Video of someone using your project (or as safe a version of that as can be managed given social distancing)
4. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)


## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
